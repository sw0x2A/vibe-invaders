# vibe-invaders
Space Invaders clone in Rust using Bevy engine

## Description
A classic Space Invaders game implemented in Rust using the Bevy game engine, following Entity Component System (ECS) architecture principles.

Built with **Rust 2024 edition** and **Bevy 0.17**, designed specifically for **WASM (WebAssembly)** deployment.

## Play Online
The game is deployed at: https://vibe-invaders.00101010.org/

## Features
- **Player-controlled ship**: Move left/right with arrow keys or A/D
- **Shooting mechanics**: Press SPACE to shoot
- **Animated starfield background**: Dynamic stars moving from center to edges, creating a high-speed flight effect
- **Colorful comic-style graphics**: Enhanced visuals with detailed, colorful sprites
- **Enemy invaders**: 5 rows × 11 columns of enemies that move back and forth (3 different types)
- **Enemy AI**: Enemies move horizontally and descend when hitting screen edges
- **Enemy shooting**: Enemies randomly shoot projectiles at the player
- **Collision detection**: Bullets destroy enemies and enemy bullets can hit the player
- **Explosion animations**: Particle-based explosions when enemies or player are destroyed
- **Sound effects**: Audio feedback for shooting and destruction
- **Score tracking**: Earn 10 points per destroyed enemy
- **Game over conditions**: When enemies reach the bottom or player is hit

## Controls
- **Arrow Keys** or **A/D**: Move left/right
- **SPACE**: Shoot

## Building and Running (WASM)

This project is designed for WASM deployment only.

### Prerequisites
- Rust (latest stable version)
- Cargo
- Rust WASM target:
  ```bash
  rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
  ```
- Trunk (WASM bundler):
  ```bash
  cargo install --locked trunk
  ```

### Build for Web
```bash
trunk build --release
```

### Run Locally
```bash
trunk serve
```
Then open http://127.0.0.1:8080 in your browser.

### GitHub Pages Deployment

The game is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the `main` branch. The deployment workflow builds the WASM bundle and publishes it to GitHub Pages.

## Architecture
The game follows ECS (Entity Component System) principles using Bevy 0.17.

## WASM Canvas Configuration
The game uses a specific canvas element (`#bevy-canvas`) for proper rendering in browsers. Key configuration:
- Canvas element with ID `bevy-canvas` in `index.html`
- `fit_canvas_to_parent: true` for responsive sizing
- `prevent_default_event_handling: true` for proper keyboard input handling
- Fixed resolution of 800×600 with responsive CSS scaling

## Future Enhancements
- Lives system
- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty
- Power-ups
- Background music
- High score persistence
- Shields/barriers
- UFO bonus ship
- Main menu and pause functionality
